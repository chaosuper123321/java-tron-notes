## Module: UdpEvent.java
Module Name: UdpEvent.java

Primary Objectives: The primary objective of this module is to handle UDP events in the ethereumJ library.

Critical Functions:
1. Constructor: Initializes the UdpEvent object with a message and an InetSocketAddress.
2. getMessage(): Retrieves the message associated with the UdpEvent.
3. setMessage(): Sets a new message for the UdpEvent.
4. getAddress(): Retrieves the InetSocketAddress associated with the UdpEvent.
5. setAddress(): Sets a new InetSocketAddress for the UdpEvent.

Key Variables:
- message: Represents the message associated with the UDP event.
- address: Represents the InetSocketAddress of the UDP event.

Interdependencies: This module interacts with the org.tron.common.backup.message.Message class to handle messages in UDP events.

Core vs. Auxiliary Operations: The core operations of this module include handling the message and address of a UDP event. Auxiliary operations may involve additional processing or validation of the message.

Operational Sequence: The operational sequence involves creating a UdpEvent object with a message and an InetSocketAddress, and then being able to retrieve or update the message and address associated with the event.

Performance Aspects: Performance considerations may include the efficiency of message handling and network communication in UDP events.

Reusability: This module can be adapted for reuse in handling UDP events in other applications or systems that require similar functionality.

Usage: The UdpEvent module is used to encapsulate the message and address information of UDP events in the ethereumJ library, providing a convenient way to manage and process such events.

Assumptions: This module assumes that the message and address provided are valid and correctly formatted for UDP event handling.
